**Discussed**

- Shared what we found after the scanning:
  - Most of us are facing some issues while using different tools to scan
  - OWASP ZAP was suggested and recommended for the scanning
  - Tony has demonstrated the OWASP ZAP during the session
  - Some documentation from other websites is provided in the call, which can be a reference for our assignment.
    1. https://loadedcommerce.com/documentation
    2. https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-12960/Softaculous.html
- Review the feedback from the Tutor on the first assignment.
  - We need a better, detailed clarification for the tables and diagrams in the document.
  - We should include reflection in the assignment as well

**Next action**

- Next meeting: next Wednesday at the same time
- Post our results in the shared document, and review them in the next call to decide which one to keep.
- We will need to decide the whole layout in the next call, so we can decide when to book a meeting with the tutor.
