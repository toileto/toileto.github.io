After finishing the final project, compared to the first project in unit 6, one important thing that I learned is that not everything that we stated in unit 6 is perfect. It’s almost impossible to have everything set and ready at the beginning. Even on something that we both agreed on early.

For example, we might think a task is hard. It turns out, that it is easier compared to our initial estimation. The same way goes for tasks that we think are easy, but turns out, that it’s harder than we thought – in my personal experiences, the worst can be carried over to up to 2 sprints. Until we get our hands on the task, we can never know the truth. This kind of situation affects our timeline for the project. 

Even something that we (team 1 and team 2) both early agreed on, the communication plan, it wasn’t running as planned. We found it hard to communicate with the other team as our stakeholders. Although I’m not sure what’s the actual reason, I suspect that this is due to our differences in time zone as well as busyness.

Anything could happen, anything can be different once we’re doing it. But I have learned that through being a proactive team player, like keeping our updates posted regularly so that the team is aware, we can easily mitigate issues that we faced during the development. Being proactive and open, and not afraid to ask for help, makes the project back on track despite issues of differences from the planning.
