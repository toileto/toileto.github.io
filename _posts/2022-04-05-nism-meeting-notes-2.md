**Discussed**

- Competed for the draft layout for our report
- Workload distribution
  - We agreed that each of us can contribute our work to each section in the layout
  - We can review the contribution of teammates and give suggestions
- Regarding the Scanning assignment, Dr. Nawas suggests we post it as a group AND post it individual (Since we already have it all) so he can see the different results from each of us

**Next action**

- We can have another call this Thursday to review our progress (same time as today)
- During the call on Thursday, we can decide if we are ready to book a session with our tutor or not
