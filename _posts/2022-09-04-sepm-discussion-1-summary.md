As we have shared our opinion about the reasons why a project failed, I can see that there is no exact answer to that question. From this discussion, I tried to dig more about it. I found that even between Forbes (Forbes Technology Council, 2020) and Entrepreneur (Smale, 2019), they even are listing several reasons that are unique only to them – not listed on the other one.

My premise is that it’s due to the element of the _people_ itself in the PPT (people, process, technology) framework. Different people might be having different characteristics. Thus, the reason can be different from one person to another. Despite the variety in the _people_ element, we might gain a pattern if we increase the size of the population sample. See what the common reasons are.
