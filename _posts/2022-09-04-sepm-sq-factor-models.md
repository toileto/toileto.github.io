McCall’s model is factored through the perspective of three sides: product operation, product revision, and product transition factors. It supports 11 factors out of 28 known factors (Boukouchi, 2013). It was the first model introduced. On the other hand, the Deutsh and Willis model is based on McCall’s model.

The Deutsch and Willis model is taking into account 2 newly suggested factors – Verifiability and Expandability, as well as introduces 3 more factors including Safety, Manageability, and Survivability. All of the factors in the Deutsch and Willis model are grouped into four categories: Functional, Performance, Change, and Management. It is an improved version of the previous model, which expands its model to cover larger factors.
