**Discussed**

- We can reuse the result that we have done in the scanning
- We have listed 12 Threats, and each of us will need to claim 3 to work on
- Basic steps: which tools we use for the scanning, why, and the result of the scanning.

**Next action**

- Next meeting: next Monday at the same time
- Review our results (fully or partially) and discuss to ensure all of us are in the same direction
