The Components of User Experience proposed (Thüring & Mahlke, 2007) doesn’t cover all aspects that affect user experience. In my opinion, there is an alternative framework that we can use, and their components are Business, Technology, and Design (Kantamneni, 2022). He argues that’s because today, 8 out of 10 of the most valuable companies are technology companies. To bring this impactful user experience design, it should be deliberately designed from all perspective of an organization.

Despite the differences between frameworks, they’re all agree on one thing. That it must be user-centric. It must guarantee customer success when they engage in the ecosystem – making sure users are getting what they want, when, where, and how they want it (Kantamneni, 2022). Thus, user experience must be delivered within these three levels, along with their explanations:
- **User Interface (UI)**. Focusing the experience of the user interface for various devices (mobile, desktop, etc.). UI is the bare minimum that an organization must think of in designing great user experience.
- **Product Experience (PX)**. This focus on the user journey when using the program. Such as user’s interactions flow optimization.
- **Experience Transformation (XT)**. This is the top level, above UI and PX. It makes sure that all designs are optimized and orchestrated across all departments, beyond the product itself.

- To excel and build the right solution on all those areas, it is critical for an organization to be data-driven in building their user experience solutions. Every individuals are unique, there is no solid factors affecting user experience – one organization might be having different factors one to another. Through quantitative or qualitative data, being data-driven will provide the right facts that are hard to argue with.
